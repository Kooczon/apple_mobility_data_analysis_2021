The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made available by Apple.

That data is available for download from the following URL:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

It currently uses dplyr to work with some of the tabular data. Eventually, it will also include use of ggplot2 to visualize the dataset.

### Change Log

* 2021-09-22: Create GitHub repository and push commits for the first time
* 2021-09-20: Initialized git repository for the project in 2021
* 2021-09-19: A new version of the data file was downloaded, and I also worked to refactor the code to be more general and to allow for any state to be subset from the larger file
