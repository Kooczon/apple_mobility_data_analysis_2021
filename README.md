The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made available by Apple.

That data is available for download from the following URL:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

It currently uses dplyr to work with some of the tabular data. Eventually, it will also include use of ggplot2 to visualize the dataset.
