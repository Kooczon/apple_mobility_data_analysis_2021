The aim of this project is to analyze the mobility data made available by Apple.

That data is available from the following URL:
https://covid19.apple.com/mobility

### Change Log

* 2021-09-19: A new version of the data file was downloaded, and I also worked to refactor the code to be more general and to allow for any state to be subset from the larger file
* 2021-09-01: It was  originally downloaded for analysis.
